# Generative AI with Large Language Models Implementation

This repository contains my implementation for the "Generative AI with Large Language Models" course offered by Coursera. The course provides a comprehensive understanding of generative AI and explores how large language models (LLMs) can be used to create value in various real-world applications.

## Course Overview

The course is divided into three modules, each covering different aspects of generative AI and LLMs. Here's a brief overview of each module:

### Module 1: Generative AI Use Cases and Model Pre-training
In this module, I learned about the project lifecycle of generative AI and LLMs. I gained insights into the transformer architecture that powers LLMs, their training process, and the concept of fine-tuning. Additionally, I explored various topics such as generative configuration, scaling laws, and computational challenges associated with training LLMs.

### Module 2: Fine-tuning and Evaluating Large Language Models
Module 2 focused on the fine-tuning process and evaluating LLMs. I learned about different techniques for fine-tuning LLMs on specific tasks and explored model evaluation methods and benchmarks. The module also covered parameter efficient fine-tuning and its associated techniques.

### Module 3: Reinforcement Learning and LLM-powered Applications
In the final module, I delved into reinforcement learning and its applications in LLM-powered systems. I gained an understanding of aligning models with human values, reinforcement learning from human feedback, and model optimizations for deployment. The module also covered topics like program-aided language models, reasoning and action, and responsible AI.

## Prerequisites

To make the most out of this implementation, it is recommended to have the following prerequisites:

- Intermediate level programming skills in Python.
- Familiarity with the basics of machine learning, including supervised and unsupervised learning, loss functions, and data splitting.
- Prior knowledge of the Machine Learning Specialization or Deep Learning Specialization offered by DeepLearning.AI is beneficial.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **Module1**: This directory contains the implementation and code related to Module 1 of the course.
- **Module2**: Here, you can find the code and implementation for Module 2.
- **Module3**: This directory includes the code and implementation for Module 3.
- **README.md**: The main readme file providing an overview of the repository and its contents.

Feel free to explore the code and implementations in each module directory to gain a deeper understanding of generative AI with large language models.
